 * to exist before the first write tool lands so we don't have to
 * retrofit it under pressure.
 *
 * ### Failure model
 *
 * The brand promise (VISION.md §85) is that the user always keeps the
 * wheel — *never* a silent automation channel. If no Haven activity is in
 * the foreground, we cannot ask the user to consent, so the request can
 * never auto-ALLOW. Since #337 (mechanism 3, maintainer-approved) a
 * backgrounded non-NEVER request no longer fails *instantly*: it emits
 * [blockedWhileBackground] (the app layer raises a tap-to-open
 * notification) and then suspends — within the caller's timeout budget —
 * waiting for foreground to return via [setForegroundActive]; the prompt
 * renders then with the remaining budget. DENY happens only on timeout or
 * an explicit deny tap. §85 holds: the only thing that changed is
 * immediate-DENY → DENY-only-on-timeout.
 *
 * ### Memoisation
 *
 * For [ConsentLevel.ONCE_PER_SESSION] decisions are cached against
 * the `(clientHint, toolName)` key for the lifetime of the manager
 * (i.e. until process death) or until [clearMemoised] is called from
 * Settings. The cache only stores ALLOW outcomes; a DENY is never
 * remembered, so a misclick can't lock the agent out forever.
