 * to exist before the first write tool lands so we don't have to
 * retrofit it under pressure.
 *
 * ### Failure model
 *
 * The brand promise (VISION.md §85) is that the user always keeps the
 * wheel — *never* a silent automation channel. That has one
 * unforgiving consequence: if no Haven activity is in the foreground,
 * we cannot ask the user to consent, so the request **must** fail
 * closed. This manager tracks foreground state via
 * [setForegroundActive] and refuses non-NEVER requests when no
 * activity is visible. The user gets a notification (wired by the UI
 * layer when this becomes load-bearing) explaining what was blocked.
 *
 * ### Memoisation
 *
 * For [ConsentLevel.ONCE_PER_SESSION] decisions are cached against
 * the `(clientHint, toolName)` key for the lifetime of the manager
 * (i.e. until process death) or until [clearMemoised] is called from
 * Settings. The cache only stores ALLOW outcomes; a DENY is never
 * remembered, so a misclick can't lock the agent out forever.
