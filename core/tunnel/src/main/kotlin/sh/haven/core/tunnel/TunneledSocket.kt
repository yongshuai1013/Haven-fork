/**
 * java.net.Socket adapter backed by a [TunneledConnection].
 *
 * Userspace tunnels (WireGuard / Tailscale) don't expose kernel sockets;
 * a [TunneledConnection] is the byte-stream surface they offer instead.
 * Some upstream libraries hard-code a Socket dependency though — VNC's
 * VeNCrypt upgrade calls `SSLSocketFactory.createSocket(socket, host,
 * port, true)` (the layered-SSL form) and smbj's SmbConfig takes a
 * javax.net.SocketFactory whose contract returns Sockets. This class
 * bridges both: hand a TunneledSocket to those APIs and they read/write
 * via the underlying TunneledConnection.
 *
 * The connection is pre-dialled — [connect] and [bind] therefore throw
 * [UnsupportedOperationException]. [close] is idempotent.
