/**
 * Engine-neutral view of one live SSH connection (#58, phase 4).
 *
 * [SshSessionManager] holds sessions as `SshConnection` rather than the
 * concrete JSch [SshClient], so a future sshlib-backed implementation can
 * enter the session pool without the manager (or the reconnect loop)
 * knowing which engine it is. New connections are built through
 * [SshConnectionFactory] — the single place the engine is chosen.
 *
 * This is the portable contract: connect/auth, a shell channel, exec, an
 * [SftpSession], port forwarding, liveness and teardown. Engine-specific
 * escape hatches that only JSch-era features use — the raw
 * `com.jcraft.jsch.ChannelSftp`, the underlying `com.jcraft.jsch.Session`
 * (jump hosts, SCP) — deliberately stay on [SshClient] and are reached by
 * narrowing, so those unported paths cannot leak onto the neutral seam.
 * The shell channel is still JSch-shaped ([ShellChannel]/[ChannelShell]);
 * that neutralisation is phase 5.
