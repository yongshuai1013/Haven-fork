// handles that are disconnected with everything else but never listed (#363) —
// and exists so its registry entry can identify itself honestly rather than
// borrowing another transport's name. GUEST is the UML guest, which follows the
// LOCAL pattern but runs a real kernel as its process.
// OPENAI is last for the same reason as RCLONE/GUEST (ordinals load-bearing):
// an HTTP client session — no terminal, no input.
