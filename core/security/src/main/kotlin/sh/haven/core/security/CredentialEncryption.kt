 * Uses its own Keystore master key (`haven_credential_master`), separate from
 * [KeyEncryption]'s `haven_ssh_key_master`, and distinct associated data, so
 * password ciphertext cannot be confused with SSH key ciphertext. (An earlier
 * version of this comment claimed the two shared a master key. They do not —
 * which matters when diagnosing a Keystore failure, because only one of the
 * two aliases may be broken.)
 *
 * Encrypted values are stored as "ENC:" + Base64(ciphertext) so they can live in
 * TEXT columns alongside legacy plaintext values. Plaintext values are migrated
 * transparently on first read/write.
