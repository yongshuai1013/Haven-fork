/**

 * an Android Context. These pin the shell fragments the shared-VM multi-drive
 * work depends on: the ro/rw mount branch, the LUKS skip-and-report branch,
 * the delta-based (not bare-existence) enumeration wait, the busid-scoped
 * (not blind port-0) retry-detach, and the appliance marker's
 * version-upgrade gate.
