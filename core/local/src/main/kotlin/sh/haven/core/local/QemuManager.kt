/**
 * Runs an on-device QEMU VM that gives phone-attached USB drives a **real
 * Linux kernel** — so mass-storage / block / ext4 / GPT, which proot has no
 * kernel for, work (#287). The VM is the USB/IP *client* the proot guest
 * can't be (Android ships no vhci-hcd): it imports the device(s) the shipped
 * [sh.haven.core.usb.UsbIpServer] exports, mounts them, and serves the files
 * over sshd. Haven points an ordinary loopback SSH/SFTP profile at it — no
 * new transport, no new UI; each drive's files appear in the normal file
 * browser.
 *
 * **One shared VM serves every open drive**, not one VM per drive. QEMU's
 * own image locking refuses a second process opening the same appliance
 * disk file (`Failed to get "write" lock` — confirmed live), and a second
 * full VM boot per drive would double RAM/boot-time for no reason: USB/IP
 * already supports attaching multiple devices to one guest (each
 * `usbip attach` opens its own connection to [sh.haven.core.usb.UsbIpServer],
 * which already dispatches by busid over one shared socket), so an
 * additional drive is just another attach+mount inside the already-running
 * guest. Up to [MAX_CONCURRENT_DRIVES] drives can be attached at once.
 *
 * Delivery = **serial-console auto-drive** (not an Alpine apkovl, which didn't
 * auto-apply from a separate disk reliably): qemu runs `-serial stdio`, so the
 * proot launcher Process's streams *are* the VM serial. We wait for `login:`,
 * send `root`, then a one-shot bootstrap script (network → usbip+openssh →
 * sshd), then a per-drive attach+mount script for each busid. This mirrors
 * what was proven by hand in the #287 spike.
 *
 * Unrooted Android = no /dev/kvm, so qemu runs TCG (slow but correct) — fine
 * for pulling files off a drive. Isochronous USB still can't pass (the broker
 * has no isochronous API).
 *
 * Orchestration note: the export (UsbIpServer) lives in `core:usb`, which this
 * module doesn't depend on, so the app layer starts the export and passes us
 * the `busid`; we only own the VM.
