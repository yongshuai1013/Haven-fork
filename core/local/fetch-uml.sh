# Fetch the UML guest transport binaries (PROTOTYPE.md in the uml-transport
# workspace) into jniLibs.
#
# The UML guest transport runs a real Linux kernel (user-mode linux) as the
# pty child, wired to passt for networking. Four binaries are involved:
#   libvmlinux.so   the UML kernel, built against bionic, static (79 MB)
#   libuml-stub.so  UML's SKAS stub (memfd exec is refused on Android, so
#                   the kernel loads it from disk via stub_exe=)
#   libuml-passt.so passt, musl static, with the PASST_RAW_L2 /
#                   PASST_NO_SANDBOX patch set (integration/passt/)
#   libuml-net.so   the socketpair launcher — built in-repo from
#                   src/main/cpp/uml_net.c (CMake), NOT fetched here
#
# Android app storage is noexec and exec is only allowed from
# nativeLibraryDir, so they ship as jniLibs. arm64-v8a only: there is no
# bionic build of this kernel for the other ABIs. Builds for other ABIs
# (and F-Droid, via -PskipUml) simply lack the guest transport; the
# NativeFeatures.uml probe hides the UI.
#
# Version-pinned release assets with sha256s (github.com/GlassOnTin/
# uml-transport, tag uml-guest-4). The kernel is GPL-2.0; its source
# (branch um-arm64 of zalexdev/linux-um-arm64 at 7edec4df1 plus the
# stub-execve-fallback and android-app-compat patches, all published
# there with the build recipes) is published, which satisfies the
# distribution terms. The kernel link output is additionally neutered
# for the syscalls Android's zygote seccomp filter force-kills
# (set_robust_list, rseq) — the gate and the patch live in this repo's
# releases repo, GlassOnTin/uml-transport, under tools/um-arm64/harness/.
# When the pin is retired,
# the fetch fails LOUDLY — bump UML_RELEASE and the sha256s together.
# Skip with ./gradlew -PskipUml or SKIP_UML=1 (F-Droid).
#
# UML_RELEASE_MIRROR overrides the base URL (file:// works) for
# offline/airgapped builds.
