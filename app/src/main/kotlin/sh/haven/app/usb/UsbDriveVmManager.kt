/**
 * Orchestrates the user-facing "Open USB drive" flow (#287): export the
 * attached USB mass-storage device over the shipped [UsbIpServer], boot the
 * [QemuManager] appliance VM (which imports + mounts it), and surface the
 * drive's files through an ordinary loopback SSH/SFTP [ConnectionProfile] — so
 * the existing file browser, terminal, and MCP file verbs all work unchanged.
 *
 * The VM boot is slow (TCG, no KVM unrooted), so [open] does the fast checks
 * (USB permission, mass-storage class) synchronously and then boots in the
 * background; callers poll [sessions]. Up to [QemuManager.MAX_CONCURRENT_DRIVES]
 * drives can be open at once, sharing ONE running VM (each additional drive
 * is just another USB/IP attach inside it, not a second boot — see
 * [QemuManager]'s class doc for why).
 *
 * The saved "USB: …" connection is a durable **bookmark** (tagged with the
 * drive's serial via [ConnectionProfile.usbDriveSerial]), not a live session.
 * [close]ing a drive always ends its own reachability (its key is revoked and
 * its mounts unmounted even if other drives keep the shared VM up); the VM
 * itself — and the port every open drive's profile currently shares — only
 * actually stops once the *last* attached drive closes (or on app-restart:
 * VM state doesn't survive the process). [reopenForProfile] (driven by
 * [UsbDriveConnectionPreflight]) reboots/reattaches and refreshes the profile
 * the moment the user clicks a dead bookmark again, instead of leaving a
 * connection that just fails.
