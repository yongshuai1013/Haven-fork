/**
 * Brings up a dedicated, headless SSH reverse tunnel to the designated
 * `mcpTunnelEndpointProfileId` endpoint host, carrying **adb-forwarding**
 * ([exposeAdbPort]) and **guest-MCP-service forwarding** ([refreshForwards])
 * — no longer Haven's own MCP endpoint itself, which now rides the user's
 * interactive session for the same profile instead (see [McpNearCarrier]).
 *
 * Why MCP moved off this class: a headless tunnel can only authenticate
 * non-interactively ([resolveHeadlessAuth] excludes FIDO2/encrypted keys,
 * since there's no UI to drive a touch prompt from a background service) and
 * otherwise falls back to trying every non-SK key in the whole keystore —
 * including keys never meant for that host. When none of those are actually
 * authorized, this class would retry a failing connection forever with no
 * way to recover short of a full app restart. [McpNearCarrier] sidesteps
 * this by reusing whatever auth the user's own interactive connection
 * already completed, instead of resolving its own.
 *
 * This class still owns its problem well: adb/guest-service forwarding
 * *does* want to work even when nothing is interactively connected, so it
 * keeps its own independent, always-reconnecting headless session — WG
 * remains MCP's own primary, always-on carrier regardless of any of this.
 * The tunnel:
 *  - rides its own [SshSessionManager] session marked `headless` (no
 *    shell channel ever opened — see [SshSessionManager.registerSession]),
 *  - uses an unlimited auto-reconnect policy that also fires on network
 *    change, so it self-heals after roams and restarts,
 *  - skips connecting entirely when there's nothing to carry (no exposed
 *    adb port, no running guest MCP service) — see the early-out in
 *    [establish] — so a not-yet-configured endpoint doesn't spin a doomed
 *    auth retry loop for nothing.
 *
 * Lifecycle is bound to the MCP endpoint toggle in `HavenApp`: [start]
 * on enable, [stop] on disable.
