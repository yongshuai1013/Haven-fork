/**
 * Every [Transport] must have a registry binding.
 *
 * Before #510, `SessionManagerRegistry` named all twelve managers in its
 * constructor, so forgetting one was a compile error — that is what stopped
 * the disconnect and terminal-input paths silently skipping a transport
 * (#363, #366). Contributing them via `@IntoSet` buys the ability to drop RDP
 * from a build variant, but gives that guarantee up: a missing binding is a
 * transport that quietly stops appearing in session lists, keeping the
 * foreground service alive, and accepting input.
 *
 * This test is the replacement guarantee. Adding a [Transport] constant
 * without a binding fails here, and so does deleting a binding.
